This program should work with Python versions between 2.7-3.7 (I am using 3.7)

Be sure to change the txtFile string path with the .txt file that you generate
Also change the pdfFile path that you will need to save/display the PDF in your program

Steps for this microservice to work:
1. change the above file paths to desired location on your computer
2. run the program
3. the PDF will be created once your txtFile has been updated
4. the PDF will be stored at the path you chose

If you rerun this microservice:
- the .txt file will have its contents erased
- the .pdf file that was previously created will be removed
    - the .pdf will be re-created once the specified .txt file has been updated
